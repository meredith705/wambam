- [ ] make better test data. 
    - Now it's a bunch of simulated short reads. 
    - Instead maybe get a subset of a few thousands real reads from a public ONT sample.
- [ ] add examples of the graphs (for an actual sample, not the simulated test data)
- [ ] script to make graphs combining multiple samples.
